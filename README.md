# Guess-Who-Board-Setup
this is for creating the guess-who board automatically from a set folder of images

To prepare:
Step 1: Prepare the folders with the images you wanted
Step 2: Name the images files with the name you want (keep in mind it will be used later)
Step 3: Open the program and select the folder and let the program do its work

Note: You might need to adjust the size of your window to make sure you can see all the images
